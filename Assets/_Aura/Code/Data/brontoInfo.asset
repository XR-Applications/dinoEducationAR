  tite: Brontosaurus
  details: 'Evidence suggests that a Brontosaurus could have weighed between 17-24
    US tons (16,000-22,000 kg), making it one of the largest dinosaurs to walk the
    earth.

    

    As these are predictions based on the length of bones discovered,
    it is possible that some could have even weighed more.

    

    It would
    have stood around 15 feet (4.6 m) tall and 70-90 feet (21-27 m) in length.'
